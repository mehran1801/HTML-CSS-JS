Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## CSS
- different ** width ** properties based on the content, like min-content, max-content and the best of both worlds * fit-content *, these properties can be used for box-sizing and grid column sizing.

## Javascript

1.  Difference between document.addEventListener and window.addEventListener?
The document and window are different objects and they have some different events. Using addEventListener() on them listens to events destined for a different object. You should use the one that actually has the event you are interested in.
